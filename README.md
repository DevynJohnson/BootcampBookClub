# Bootcamp Bookclub

## Installation
No installation required, application is designed to run in web browser.

## Usage
An application inspired by Goodreads, Bootcamp Book Club is a fun way for users to set and track their personal reading goals. Starting with a database of 100 classic novels and stories from authors around the world, users are shown a random book when the page loads that can be added to the userâ€™s personal reading list that can be marked as completed when finished. If there are books outside of that list, the user is able to add their own books to the database and enter information such as title, author, publication year, a link to the cover art to be displayed and more.
